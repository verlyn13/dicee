Single Redirects allow you to create static or dynamic URL redirects. A simple interface with [wildcard support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#wildcard-matching) makes it easy to define source and target URL patterns without needing complex functions or regular expressions, efficiently handling thousands of URLs with a single rule. Dynamic URL redirects also support advanced features such as string replacement operations and [regular expressions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/values/#string-values-and-regular-expressions) (depending on your Cloudflare plan).

For more complex and customized redirect logic, consider using [Snippets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/snippets/).
