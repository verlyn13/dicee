Bindings allow your Worker to interact with resources on the Cloudflare Developer Platform. Bindings provide better performance and less restrictions when accessing resources from Workers than the [REST APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/) which are intended for non-Workers applications.

The following bindings are available today:

* [AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/workers-wrangler/#2-connect-your-worker-to-workers-ai)
* [Analytics Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine)
* [Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/binding/)
* [Browser Rendering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering)
* [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/worker-api/)
* [Dispatcher (Workers for Platforms)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/get-started/configuration/)
* [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/)
* [Dynamic Worker Loaders](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/worker-loader/)
* [Environment Variables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/)
* [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive)
* [Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/transform-images/bindings/)

## What is a binding?

When you declare a binding on your Worker, you grant it a specific capability, such as being able to read and write files to an [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) bucket. For example:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "main": "./src/index.js",
    "r2_buckets": [
      {
        "binding": "MY_BUCKET",
        "bucket_name": "<MY_BUCKET_NAME>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  main = "./src/index.js"
  r2_buckets = [
    { binding = "MY_BUCKET", bucket_name = "<MY_BUCKET_NAME>" }
  ]
  ```

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const key = url.pathname.slice(1);
    await env.MY_BUCKET.put(key, request.body);
    return new Response(`Put ${key} successfully!`);
  },
};
```

You can think of a binding as a permission and an API in one piece. With bindings, you never have to add secret keys or tokens to your Worker in order to access resources on your Cloudflare account — the permission is embedded within the API itself. The underlying secret is never exposed to your Worker's code, and therefore can't be accidentally leaked.

## Making changes to bindings

When you deploy a change to your Worker, and only change its bindings (i.e. you don't change the Worker's code), Cloudflare may reuse existing isolates that are already running your Worker. This improves performance — you can change an environment variable or other binding without unnecessarily reloading your code.

As a result, you must be careful when "polluting" global scope with derivatives of your bindings. Anything you create there might continue to exist despite making changes to any underlying bindings. Consider an external client instance which uses a secret API key accessed from `env`: if you put this client instance in global scope and then make changes to the secret, a client instance using the original value might continue to exist. The correct approach would be to create a new client instance for each request.

The following is a good approach:

```ts
export default {
  fetch(request, env) {
    let client = new Client(env.MY_SECRET); // `client` is guaranteed to be up-to-date with the latest value of `env.MY_SECRET` since a new instance is constructed with every incoming request


    // ... do things with `client`
  },
};
```

Compared to this alternative, which might have surprising and unwanted behavior:

```ts
let client = undefined;


export default {
  fetch(request, env) {
    client ??= new Client(env.MY_SECRET); // `client` here might not be updated when `env.MY_SECRET` changes, since it may already exist in global scope


    // ... do things with `client`
  },
};
```

If you have more advanced needs, explore the [AsyncLocalStorage API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/asynclocalstorage/), which provides a mechanism for exposing values down to child execution handlers.

## How to access `env`

Bindings are located on the `env` object, which can be accessed in several ways:

* It is an argument to entrypoint handlers such as [`fetch`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/):

  ```js
  export default {
    async fetch(request, env) {
      return new Response(`Hi, ${env.NAME}`);
    },
  };
  ```

- It is as class property on [WorkerEntrypoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/rpc/#bindings-env), [DurableObject](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/), and [Workflow](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/):

  ```js
  export class MyDurableObject extends DurableObject {
    async sayHello() {
      return `Hi, ${this.env.NAME}!`;
    }
  }
  ```

- It can be imported from `cloudflare:workers`:

  ```js
  import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";
  console.log(`Hi, ${env.Name}`);
  ```

### Importing `env` as a global

Importing `env` from `cloudflare:workers` is useful when you need to access a binding such as [secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) or [environment variables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) in top-level global scope. For example, to initialize an API client:

```js
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";
import ApiClient from "example-api-client";


// API_KEY and LOG_LEVEL now usable in top-level scope
let apiClient = ApiClient.new({ apiKey: env.API_KEY });
const LOG_LEVEL = env.LOG_LEVEL || "info";


export default {
  fetch(req) {
    // you can use apiClient or LOG_LEVEL, configured before any request is handled
  },
};
```

Workers do not allow I/O from outside a request context. This means that even though `env` is accessible from the top-level scope, you will not be able to access every binding's methods.

For instance, environment variables and secrets are accessible, and you are able to call `env.NAMESPACE.get` to get a [Durable Object stub](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/stub/) in the top-level context. However, calling methods on the Durable Object stub, making [calls to a KV store](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/api/), and [calling to other Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings) will not work.

```js
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";


// This would error!
// env.KV.get('my-key')


export default {
  async fetch(req) {
    // This works
    let myVal = await env.KV.get("my-key");
    Response.new(myVal);
  },
};
```

Additionally, importing `env` from `cloudflare:workers` lets you avoid passing `env` as an argument through many function calls if you need to access a binding from a deeply-nested function. This can be helpful in a complex codebase.

```js
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";


export default {
  fetch(req) {
    Response.new(sayHello());
  },
};


// env is not an argument to sayHello...
function sayHello() {
  let myName = getName();
  return `Hello, ${myName}`;
}


// ...nor is it an argument to getName
function getName() {
  return env.MY_NAME;
}
```

Note

While using `env` from `cloudflare:workers` may be simpler to write than passing it through a series of function calls, passing `env` as an argument is a helpful pattern for dependency injection and testing.

### Overriding `env` values

The `withEnv` function provides a mechanism for overriding values of `env`.

Imagine a user has defined the [environment variable](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) "NAME" to be "Alice" in their Wrangler configuration file and deployed a Worker. By default, logging `env.NAME` would print "Alice". Using the `withEnv` function, you can override the value of "NAME".

```js
import { env, withEnv } from "cloudflare:workers";


function logName() {
  console.log(env.NAME);
}


export default {
  fetch(req) {
    // this will log "Alice"
    logName();


    withEnv({ NAME: "Bob" }, () => {
      // this will log "Bob"
      logName();
    });


    // ...etc...
  },
};
```

This can be useful when testing code that relies on an imported `env` object.
