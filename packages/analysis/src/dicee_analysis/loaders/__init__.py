"""
Data loaders for Dicee simulation results.

Supports loading from NDJSON (streaming) and Parquet (efficient) formats.

Example:
    >>> from dicee_analysis.loaders import load_games, convert_to_parquet
    >>> 
    >>> # Load NDJSON directly (slower but works with raw output)
    >>> games = load_games("results/games.ndjson")
    >>> 
    >>> # Convert to Parquet first (recommended for large datasets)
    >>> convert_to_parquet("results/", "results/parquet/")
    >>> games = load_games("results/parquet/games.parquet")
