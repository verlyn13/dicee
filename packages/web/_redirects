# Cloudflare Pages Redirects

#
# NOTE: These redirects only work for STATIC assets.
# SvelteKit dynamic routes bypass this file entirely.
# For host-based redirects (dicee.jefahnierocks.com → gamelobby),
# use Cloudflare Single Redirects in the dashboard:
#   Rules → Overview → Create rule → Redirect Rule

# Legacy route redirects for static assets only
