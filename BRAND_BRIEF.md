**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Domain:** dicee.games

## Brand Positioning

### One-Liner
Dicee is a no-install browser gaming platform for classic games reimagined—built for families and friends who want to play together without the crapware.

### Positioning Statement
For families and friend groups who want to play casual games together, Dicee is the browser-based gaming platform that delivers classic games with modern design and zero friction. Unlike app store games bloated with ads, account walls, and addiction mechanics, Dicee is an indie-spirited platform built for genuine fun—not profit extraction.

### Competitive Frame
Dicee competes against:
- App store dice/card games (Yahtzee With Buddies, etc.)
- Browser party games (Jackbox, Board Game Arena)
- Physical board games (when distance is a factor)

**Dicee wins by being:** Simpler than Jackbox, cleaner than app store games, more accessible than physical games for remote play.

---

## Brand Pillars

### 1. Zero Friction
No app install. No account required to join. No ads. No dark patterns. Open a link, play immediately.

### 2. Made With Love
Indie game energy—built because it's fun to build, not to maximize ad revenue. Design choices serve players, not engagement metrics.

### 3. Together, Anywhere
Synchronous play for people who aren't in the same room. Spectator mode and shoutouts make even watching feel like participating.

### 4. Simple ≠ Boring
Classic games with modern aesthetics and thoughtful enhancements. Complexity where it adds fun, simplicity everywhere else.

---

## Target Audience

### Primary: The Organizer (Ages 25-45)
The person who texts the group "anyone want to play something tonight?" Comfortable with technology, values quality experiences, organizes game nights (virtual or physical). They discover Dicee and invite others.

### Secondary: The Participants (Ages 9-70)
Family members and friends who join via invite. Range from tech-comfortable to tech-hesitant. They need the experience to be immediately understandable—no tutorials, no learning curve, no "wait how do I...?"

### Tertiary: Spectators
People who want to watch and cheer but not play. The shoutout mechanic gives them a role.

### Audience Truth
*"I want to play games with people I care about without fighting through ads, accounts, and apps that feel like they're trying to scam me."*

---

## Brand Personality

---

## Visual Identity Direction

### Design Philosophy: Neo-Brutalist Play
Combine the honesty and boldness of neo-brutalism with the warmth and approachability needed for a family game. Strong shapes, clear hierarchy, intentional constraints—but never cold or intimidating.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Clarity over decoration** — Every element earns its place
2. **Bold but warm** — Strong visual choices, friendly execution
3. **Touch-first** — Designed for thumbs, generous tap targets
4. **Motion with purpose** — Animation that communicates, not decorates
5. **Accessibility by default** — Contrast, sizing, and interaction patterns that work for everyone

### Color Direction (to be refined)
- Primary palette should feel playful but not childish
- Avoid the primary-color-rainbow of typical casual games
- Consider: warm neutrals + one or two bold accent colors
- Ensure strong contrast ratios for accessibility

### Typography Direction
- One or two typefaces maximum
- Highly legible at small sizes (mobile-first)
- Personality in headlines, neutrality in UI text
- Tabular figures for scores/numbers

### Iconography
- Simple, recognizable, consistent stroke weight
- Avoid emoji-style illustrations
- Icons should feel like part of a system

---

## Audio Identity

*Audio generation framework already in development (ElevenLabs-based tooling)*

### Audio Pillars
- **Satisfying** — Dice rolls and score reveals should feel physically good
- **Celebratory but not overwhelming** — Wins feel great without assaulting the player
- **Layered tension** — Music builds with game state, not constant stimulation
- **Respectful of context** — Easy to mute, no autoplay on first visit

### Key Sound Moments
- Dice roll (the signature sound)
- Dice selection/deselection (tactile feedback)
- Score reveal (positive reinforcement)
- "Dicee!" fanfare (the big moment)
- Turn transitions (subtle, orienting)

---

## Naming Architecture

### Platform Name
**Dicee** — The overarching platform/brand

### Game Names (Future)
Individual games within Dicee could follow patterns like:
- Descriptive: "Dicee Dice" or just contextual (the dice game on Dicee)
- Distinct names: Each game gets its own name under the Dicee umbrella
- *Recommendation: Keep the first game simple ("Play Dice on Dicee" or similar) and develop naming conventions as the platform grows*

### Open Source vs. Private
Consider clear differentiation if needed:
- **Dicee** — The public, open-source platform
- **Dicee [something]** — Enhanced private version (if distinct branding needed)
- *Or: Keep one brand, differentiate by feature availability*

---

## Tagline Options

### Functional
- "Play together. No app required."
- "Classic games, zero friction."
- "Games for family and friends."

### Emotional
- "The way games should feel."
- "Play like you mean it."
- "Built for fun, not ads."

### Cheeky
- "No ads. No accounts. No kidding."
- "Games without the garbage."
- "Finally, a game that respects you."

*Recommendation: Test a few with real users. The anti-crapware angle is strong but may not be needed once players experience the product—the quality speaks for itself.*

---

## Key Messages

### For The Organizer
"Start a game in seconds. Share a link. Everyone plays—no downloads, no accounts, no ads. Just the game."

### For Hesitant Participants
"Just tap the link. You're in. It works on your phone's browser."

### For Skeptics
"No ads. No tricks. No data harvesting. Just a game, built by someone who wanted a better way to play with family."

---

## Brand Don'ts

1. **Never guilt or pressure** — No "your friends are waiting!" manipulation
2. **Never fake scarcity** — No countdown timers, limited offers, etc.
3. **Never dark pattern** — No hidden costs, confusing flows, or accidental purchases
4. **Never over-notify** — Respect attention; notify only when genuinely useful
5. **Never feel corporate** — Avoid stock imagery, marketing-speak, or "synergy"
6. **Never sacrifice clarity for cleverness** — If a joke confuses, cut it

# Dicee: Open/Closed Source Model

**Addendum to Brand Brief v1.0**

---

## Context

Dicee will eventually have two variants:
1. **Open source** — The core platform, freely available, community-friendly
2. **Private/enhanced** — Jeffrey's personal instance with additional features, experimental games, and family/friends-specific functionality

The goal is to establish naming and positioning now that:
- Requires minimal migration effort when ready
- Keeps branding clean and non-confusing
- Doesn't make the open source version feel "lesser"
- Aligns with the indie/authentic brand values

---

## Model Options

### Option A: Single Brand, Instance-Based

**Approach:** One brand name, differentiation by deployment/instance.

| Variant | Name | Domain | Description |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| Open source | Dicee | github.com/... | Self-hostable platform |
| Private instance | Dicee | dicee.games | Jeffrey's hosted instance |

**Pros:**
- Simplest branding—no split identity
- Open source feels like "the real thing," not a lesser tier
- Natural for indie projects (this is how most indie games work)
- Zero migration effort—name never changes

**Cons:**
- Less clear differentiation if features diverge significantly
- "Dicee" search results mix both contexts

**Migration effort:** None. Just document which features are in which repo.

---

### Option B: Core + Edition Model (GitLab-style)

**Approach:** Same base name with edition suffixes.

| Variant | Name | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Open source | Dicee Community | Full open source platform |
| Private | Dicee Family | Enhanced with private features |

**Pros:**
- Clear differentiation
- "Community" signals open source without saying "free" or "basic"
- "Family" reinforces the core audience and feels warm

**Cons:**
- Adds naming complexity
- "Community Edition" can feel corporate
- Need to decide when to use full name vs. just "Dicee"

**Migration effort:** Low. Add "Community" to open source repo/docs when forking. dicee.games remains just "Dicee" in UI.

---

### Option C: Base + Plus Model (Consumer SaaS-style)

**Approach:** Base name for open source, modifier for enhanced.

| Variant | Name | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Open source | Dicee | Core platform |
| Private | Dicee+ | Enhanced features |

**Pros:**
- Familiar pattern (Disney+, Apple TV+, etc.)
- "+" is lightweight, doesn't need explanation
- Works well in UI (small badge/indicator)

**Cons:**
- "+" implies paid/premium, which may not fit the model
- Could feel less indie, more corporate
- Trademark considerations with the + symbol

**Migration effort:** Low. Add "+" badge to private instance UI.

---

### Option D: Separate Sub-brand for Games

**Approach:** Platform is Dicee, games have their own names.

| Level | Name | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Platform | Dicee | The overall brand |
| Open source game | Dice Roll | The Yahtzee-style game, open source |
| Private games | [Various names] | Family-specific or experimental games |

**Pros:**
- Scales well as game library grows
- Each game can have its own identity
- Open source is per-game, not platform-wide

**Cons:**
- More naming work upfront
- Platform vs. game distinction may confuse users
- Overkill for current stage

**Migration effort:** Medium. Need to establish game naming conventions.

---

## Recommendation: Option A (Single Brand, Instance-Based)

**Why this fits Dicee:**

1. **Matches indie ethos** — Most indie games don't have "editions." The game is the game. You can get it on Steam, itch.io, or self-host—same game.

2. **Simplest mental model** — "Dicee is Dicee." dicee.games is where Jeffrey hosts it. You can also self-host from the repo.

3. **No "lesser" version** — The open source isn't missing something; Jeffrey's instance just has some extras he's tinkering with.

4. **Zero migration** — You're already building "Dicee." Just keep building it.

5. **Future flexibility** — If the model changes later (monetization, SaaS tier, etc.), you can add naming then. Starting simple is reversible; starting complex is harder to simplify.

### How It Works in Practice

**Repository:**
```
dicee/                    # Open source monorepo
├── packages/
│   ├── web/             # Core game UI (always open source)
│   ├── worker/          # Cloudflare Worker (always open source)
│   └── ...
└── README.md            # "Dicee - Open source multiplayer gaming platform"
```

**Private features** (choose one approach):

*Approach 1: Separate private repo*
```
dicee-private/            # Private repo, imports from dicee
├── packages/
│   ├── games/           # Experimental/family games
│   └── features/        # Private-only features
└── ...
```

*Approach 2: Feature flags in monorepo*
```
dicee/
├── packages/
│   ├── web/
│   │   └── src/
│   │       └── features/
│   │           ├── core/        # Open source
│   │           └── private/     # Excluded from OSS releases, or behind flags
```

**Brand messaging:**

| Context | What to say |
|---------|-------------|
| GitHub README | "Dicee is an open source multiplayer gaming platform. Self-host it or play at dicee.games." |
| dicee.games landing | "Dicee — Play together. No app required." (No mention of open source unless relevant) |
| Asked about OSS | "Dicee is open source! You can self-host it or contribute on GitHub." |
| Private features | "Some features on dicee.games are still experimental and not in the open source release yet." |

---

## Implementation Checklist

When ready to formalize the open source release:

### Branding
- [ ] Add LICENSE file (MIT? AGPL? Choose based on goals)
- [ ] GitHub repo description and social preview image
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md with brand voice guidelines
- [ ] README badges (build status, license, etc.)

### Documentation
- [ ] Self-hosting guide
- [ ] Feature comparison (if private features diverge significantly)
- [ ] Architecture overview for contributors

### Technical
- [ ] Decide on feature flag vs. separate repo approach
- [ ] Environment variable or config for "instance type" if needed
- [ ] Ensure no private API keys or family-specific data in OSS release

### Community
- [ ] Decide on contribution model (PRs welcome? Specific areas only?)
- [ ] Code of conduct
- [ ] Issue/PR templates

---

## Future Considerations

If Dicee grows and needs clearer differentiation later, the path from Option A → Option B or C is straightforward:

1. Keep "Dicee" for the hosted/enhanced version at dicee.games
2. Add "Community" or "Open Source" suffix to the repo/self-hosted version
3. Update README and docs
4. No UI changes needed for dicee.games users

This is a one-way door that's easy to walk through later, but not necessary now.

| **Private instance name** | Dicee (at dicee.games) |
| **Differentiation** | By deployment/instance, not name |
| **Migration effort** | None |
